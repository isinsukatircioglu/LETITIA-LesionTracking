<img src="documentation/assets/LesionLocatorLogo.png" />

This repository contains the official implementation of our CVPR 2025 paper:

### 🎯 **LesionLocator: Zero-Shot Universal Tumor Segmentation and Tracking in 3D Whole-Body Imaging**


The paper introduces a novel framework for **zero-shot lesion segmentation** and **longitudinal tumor tracking** in 3D full-body imaging. By combining a large-scale lesion dataset, promptable segmentation, and deep-learning-based image registration, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results for both tasks.

## 🚀 Features & Usage

LesionLocator has **two main modes**:

### 1️⃣ Zero-Shot Lesion Segmentation (Single Timepoint)

Perform universal lesion segmentation using **point** or **3D bounding box** prompts. No lesion type–specific fine-tuning required.

#### Usage

```bash
LesionLocator_segment
    -i /path/to/image(s)
    -p /path/to/prompt(s) 
    -t box 
    -o /path/to/output/folder
    -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint 
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-i` | **Input image(s)**: Path to an image file (`.nii.gz`) or a folder containing multiple images. |
| `-p` | **Prompt(s)**: Can be either `.json` files containing 3D point or box coordinates, or `.nii.gz` instance segmentation maps. Prompts must have the same filename as their corresponding input image. Binary masks will be automatically converted to instance maps.  More info [here](/documentation/prompting.md). |
| `-t` | **Prompt type**: Choose between `point` or `box`. Determines how the model interprets the prompts. Default is `box`. |
| `-o` | **Output folder**: Path where the predicted segmentation masks will be saved. Created automatically if it doesn't exist. |
| `-m` | **Model folder**: Path to the downloaded `LesionLocatorCheckpoint` directory containing trained model weights. |
| `-f` | **Model folds**: Specify one or more folds. Defaults to all 5 folds for ensemble prediction. |
| `--disable_tta` | Disables test-time augmentation (TTA) using mirroring. Speeds up inference at the cost of accuracy. |
| `--continue_prediction`, `--c` | Continues a previously interrupted run by skipping existing output files. |
| `--visualize` | Opens results in a `napari` viewer for inspection. Requires `napari[all]` installed. |


🧠 If you provide a 3D (instance) segmentation mask as a prompt, LesionLocator will internally extract the bounding boxes or points automatically, depeding on the specified prompt type `-t`. Details on how to handle promting and the .json format can be found [here](/documentation/prompting.md). You can also run `LesionLocator_segment -h` for help. 

**Examples:**

```bash
LesionLocator_segment -i image.nii.gz -p label.nii.gz -t box -o /output/folder -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint 
```
```bash
LesionLocator_segment -i image.nii.gz -p points.json -t point -o /output/folder -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint 
```
```bash
LesionLocator_segment -i /image/folder -p /prompts/folder -t box -o /output/folder -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint 
```

### 2️⃣ Lesion Segmentation & Tracking Across Timepoints (Longitudinal)

Includes the lesion segmentation above but also tracks lesions across multiple timepoints using previous labels or prompts.

#### Usage

```bash
LesionLocator_track
    -bl /path/to/baseline.nii.gz
    -fu /path/to/followup1.nii.gz /path/to/followup2.nii.gz
    -p /path/to/baseline_prompt_or_mask(s)
    -t prev_mask
    -o /path/to/output
    -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint
```

#### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-bl` | **Baseline scan**: Path to the `.nii.gz` image used as the baseline. Must match format expected by the model (or dataset config). |
| `-fu` | **Follow-up scan(s)**: One or more `.nii.gz` files representing follow-up timepoints. Provide multiple paths separated by space for autoregressive tracking. |
| `-p` | **Prompt**: Path to the baseline prompt. Can be one `.nii.gz` instance segmentation mask or list of several semantic segmentation masks. Can also be a `.json` file with a point/box prompt. Used to initialize tracking. More info [here](/documentation/prompting.md). |
| `-o` | **Output folder**: Where tracked lesion segmentations will be saved. Created automatically if it doesn't exist. |
| `-t` | **Prompt type**: Options: `point`, `box`, or `prev_mask`. Use `point`/`box` to trigger segmentation of baseline lesions before tracking. Use `prev_mask` to track from an existing baseline label mask directly. Default is `prev_mask`. |
| `-m` | **Model folder**: Path to the `LesionLocatorCheckpoint` directory containing tracking model weights. |
| `-device` | **Device selection**: Options are `cuda`, `cpu`, or `mps` (Apple Silicon). Controls where the inference runs. Default is `cuda`. |

You can also run `LesionLocator_track -h` for help.

**Examples**

This will do both the segmentation of the baseline scan using box prompts generated from `baseline_label.nii.gz` and then track each lesion:
```bash
LesionLocator_track -bl baseline.nii.gz -fu followup.nii.gz -p baseline_label.nii.gz -t box -o output/folder -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint
```

Similarly works with `.json` prompts:
```bash
LesionLocator_track -bl baseline.nii.gz -fu followup.nii.gz -p points.json -t point -o output/folder -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint
```

This will trigger *just the tracking* (`-t prev_mask`) of all provided semantic masks autoregressively for all follow-ups:
```bash
LesionLocator_track -bl baseline.nii.gz -fu followup1.nii.gz followup2.nii.gz -p mask1.nii.gz mask2.nii.gz mask3.nii.gz -t prev_mask -o output/folder -m /path/to/LesionLocatorCheckpoint
```

 To run inference with LesionLocator, you need to download the pretrained model checkpoint: 

#### [🔗 Download LesionLocator Checkpoint](https://zenodo.org/records/15174217)

Once downloaded, extract the contents and use the `-m` argument in the CLI tools to point to the directory named `LesionLocatorCheckpoint`. Let us know if you run into issues downloading or loading checkpoints!

## 🗃️ Lesion Dataset with Synthetic Follow-Ups

We have released the **Lesion Dataset with Synthetic Follow-Ups** [here](https://doi.dkfz.de/10.6097/DKFZ/IR/E230/20250324_1.zip) (ca. 700 GB), which includes simulated follow-up scans with consistent instance labels. Due to image size, quality, or licensing constraints, not all images were used to synthesize a second timepoint and were excluded from this dataset. We reccomend downloading e.g. with `wget` since our servers can sometimes be a bit unstable.

```bash
wget -c --no-check-certificate -O LesionLocator_SynteticLongitudinalDataset.zip https://doi.dkfz.de/10.6097/DKFZ/IR/E230/20250324_1.zip
```

#### **⚠ Important Notes**  
- **Instance-based labels (not semantic):** Lesions in a single patient scan are labeled consecutively, and the same lesion retains the same label across both timepoints.
- **Synthetic deformations & segmentation masks:** Some images contain **unrealistic deformations** or **challenging segmentation masks**, which may serve as useful test cases for **improving automated analysis methods**.  
- **Recommended use:** This dataset is **ideal for pretraining** or for use **alongside real longitudinal data** to enhance model robustness and generalization.
- **Longitudinal tracking tip:** When using this dataset for **longitudinal tracking**, we highly recommend **cropping one image during data augmentation** to **increase (translational) misalignment** and better simulate real-world conditions. 

#### **Included Datasets**  
This dataset incorporates lesion data from various publicly available sources:
